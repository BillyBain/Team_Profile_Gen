# Description
Team_Profile_Gen is a program used to create a html of a team so that a manager can easily see and access names and info.

2: With an integrated terminal run 'npm i'

# Test Instructions
Once 'npm start' is running you will be prompted with a series of questions and answer them how you would like but remember employees will be displayed in the order you put them in. Once you have entered in all employees then select 'No' on the "add more employees question" then the html will be generated in the '/dist' folder.

# Thoughts
This week was a tough one for me. It took a while for me to grasp this and I had to rewatch the recordings of the classes a few times. I am glad I got it to function but I will definitely have to do more research on this to improve it down the line.
